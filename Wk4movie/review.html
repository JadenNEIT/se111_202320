                <p><i>February 5, 2023</i></p>

                <p>In my opinion, <b>Black Adam</b> was an amazing visual movie to watch in perosn. If you are a DC comic or a Marvel fan,
                this is the perfect movie for those. The movie has its own storyline of <b>Black Adam</b> and how he became the villian/hero he is.
            This movie peaked my interest because the star charcter is <b>Dwayne</b> <i>"The Rock"</i> <b>Johnson.</b> It was a funny and pleasureful sight so see him
        saving everyone as Black Adam and bringing peace to the people again as the chief.</p>

                    <h3><em>Black Adam </em>Fun Facts</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Long before his acquisition by DC, Black Adam was created by Fawcett Comics writers Otto Binder and C.C. Beck. He first appeared as the Ancient Egyptian “Teth-Adam” in the 1945 issue of The Marvel Family #1, a good-hearted man handpicked by the wizard Shazam to become an all-powerful hero.
                             Adam had to simply say the word, “Shazam,” and Black Adam was born, with a host of powers and an all-new black suit.</li>
