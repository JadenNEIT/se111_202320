            <p>Hello! My name is jaden Agnew and this is my first web page i've made here at <b>NEIT.</b> I am 19 years of age and this is my <u>second semester of campus living.</u>
            So far, school has not been so bad here, I like the teaching environment that every professor provides for us, keeping us focused
            while being able to have a <b>laugh.</b> Currently, I am enrolled in the <i>three</i> year cybersecurity bachelors program. I have <u>already</u>
            learned so much about my major and I am excited to get into the rest of the curriculam and finish up my degree! 
            
            
            </p>
